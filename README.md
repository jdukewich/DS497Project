This is a class Final Project for Data Science 497 (Principles of Artificial Intelligence) at Penn State University. Modeling a Sudoku puzzle as a constraint satisfaction problem allows for interesting variations in the solutions. Our team investigated the runtimes of various heuristics that are commonly used in constraint satisfaction problems. Please check out the Final Project PDF file to see our full report.
